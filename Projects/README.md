#projects
Here for my projects.
I’m documenting how I build secure-by-default workflows across code, cloud, and people—so security feels natural, not heavy.
# Labs (what’s inside)
- `labs/appsec`: SAST (CodeQL), DAST (ZAP), dependency scanning, SBOMs.  
- `labs/cloud`: IAM least-privilege, policy-as-code (tfsec/OPA), secure deploy roles.  
- `labs/automation`: GitHub Actions workflows (fail-on-critical, artifact signing).  
- `labs/detection-response`: Queries/playbooks for auth anomalies & phishing.
