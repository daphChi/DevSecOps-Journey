# DevSecOps-Journey
My hands-on learning journey into DevSecOps: Linux, Git, Cloud, IaC, CI/CD, Kubernetes, Security, Monitoring, and Automation.
# üöÄ DevSecOps Journey

Welcome to my DevSecOps learning journey!  
This repository serves as my hands-on logbook as I develop skills in Linux, Git, Cloud, Infrastructure as Code, Kubernetes, CI/CD, and Security.

## üéØ Goals
- Build a solid foundation in **Linux, Git, and Cloud (AWS)**.
- Learn **Infrastructure as Code** using Terraform.
- Deploy real projects with **Docker & Kubernetes**.
- Design secure **CI/CD pipelines** for modern apps.
- Practice **DevSecOps principles**: security scanning, secrets management, IAM, monitoring.
- Share my journey openly through code, notes, and mini-projects.

## üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap
This roadmap is adapted from real DevSecOps skill paths:

1. **Linux & Git Fundamentals** (/Linux)
   - Master SSH, file permissions, systemctl, bash scripting
   - Deep dive into Git (rebase, merge conflicts, branching)

2. **Cloud Specialization (AWS)**
   - IAM, EC2, S3, VPC basics
   - Deploy workloads on AWS

3. **Infrastructure as Code** (/terraform)
   - Terraform basics ‚Üí modules ‚Üí deploy infra on AWS

4. **Containers & Kubernetes**
   - Dockerize an app
   - Deploy to Kubernetes (minikube, then AWS EKS)

5. **CI/CD Pipelines**  (/git)
   - GitHub Actions (build, test, deploy)
   - Add security scans in pipelines

6. **Security Practices**
   - Container scanning (Trivy, Anchore)
   - Secrets management (Vault, AWS Secrets Manager)
   - IAM least privilege

7. **Monitoring & Reliability**
   - Prometheus + Grafana basics
   - Logging, metrics, alerting

8. **Automation & Chaos Engineering**
   - Automate workflows with scripts
   - Break things safely to learn resilience

## üìö Tracking Progress
- Weekly commits showing hands-on progress
- Notes and diagrams in `/notes/`
- Mini-projects in `/projects/`

Follow along as I move from fundamentals ‚Üí advanced DevSecOps practice!
